## About

This introduction page inspired and modify from [https://github.com/STRML/strml.net](https://github.com/STRML/strml.net).
We think that the live automatic coding and typing introduction text are pretty cool, hope you guys like it. ü§ó

In order to cut back the animation time and get more time to show the company introduction, we actually have cheated a bit by adding some initial style in advance üòù
