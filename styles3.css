/**
 * By the way, you can edit this box. Try adding new CSS!
 *
 * For example,
 *
 * The property 'text-shadow' takes the parameters:
 * 'x', 'y', 'blur', 'color'.
 *
 * So if I wanted to mirror the values,
 * I could place a shadow 15px under it, with a little blur for effect:

.value {
  text-shadow: 0px 15px 1px white;
